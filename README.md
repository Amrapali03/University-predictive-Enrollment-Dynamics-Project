# University-Predictive-Enrollment-Dynamics-Project

## Project Overview
This project, titled "Decoding Enrollment Dynamics: Unveiling Trends and Drivers of Student Matriculation," provides a comprehensive analysis of student enrollment trends and factors influencing matriculation decisions at Albers over the past four years. Our team utilized data analysis and predictive modeling to understand the dynamics of student enrollment and to forecast future enrollment patterns.

## Key Findings
### Trends
A general decline in total student enrollment over the past four years, with a notable increase in the number of students deciding against enrollment after initial acceptance.
Specific programs such as Masters and MBA have seen significant declines, while Certificate programs have maintained relatively steady enrollment numbers.

### Influencing Factors
Demographic Factors: Females are slightly more likely to enroll than males. The majority of enrollments are individuals aged 25-34. There is a marked underrepresentation of Black students, suggesting a need for increased diversity and inclusion efforts.
Academic Factors: Medium to high GPAs are prevalent among enrolled students across various programs, with suggestions for programs to consider applicants with a broader range of GPAs.

## Insights from Data Analysis
Key insights include the low actual enrollment rate of 12.26%, despite a higher rate of acceptance decisions.
Financial aids and scholarships are critical, particularly in the MBA program, where increasing support could boost matriculation rates.

## Predictions
Using a Time Series Model (SARIMAX), we forecasted application outcomes for 2024 and 2025 across MBA, Masters, and Certificate Programs. The predictions aim to help in planning and resource allocation for upcoming academic sessions.

## Models Used
Decision Tree Model: Identified factors influencing the likelihood of matriculation, such as location (applicants from WA), scholarship availability, and referral sources.
Random Forest Model: Focused on predicting enrollments in main programs for the next two years.
Time Series Forecasting: Utilized to predict application numbers for various programs, aiding in strategic planning and operational adjustments.

## Conclusion
The analysis provided by the "Decoding Enrollment Dynamics" project aids in understanding the complex factors affecting student matriculation and offers actionable insights for enhancing program attractiveness and student diversity. These findings and predictions serve as a valuable resource for strategic decision-making in academic program management and marketing.
